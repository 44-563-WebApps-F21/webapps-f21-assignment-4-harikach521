    <h6 class="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p>d, after all, whom did I wrong by what I did?  No
one.</p>
<h6 class="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="d">[_Looking at him steadily_.]</p>  <p>Except yourself, Robert.</p>

<h6 class="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN"> SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p class="d">[_After a pause_.]</p>  <p>Of course I had private
information about a certain transaction contemplated by the Government of
the day, and I acted on it.  Private information is practically the
source of every large modern fortune.</p>

<h6 class="LORD_GORING">LORD GORING.</h6>  <p class="d">[_Tapping his boot with his cane_.]</p>  <p>And public scandal
invariably the result.</p>

<h6 class="SIR_ROBERT_CHILTERN">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>  <p class="d">[_Pacing up and down the room_.]</p>  <p>Arthur, do you
think that what I did nearly eighteen years ago should be brought up
against me now?  Do you think it fair that a man’s whole career should be
ruined for a fault done in one’s boyhood almost?  I was twenty-two at the
time, and I had the double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two
unforgiveable things nowadays.  Is it fair that the folly, the sin of
one’s youth, if men choose to call it a sin, should wreck a life like
mine, should place me in the pillory, should shatter all that I have
worked for, all that I have built up.  Is it fair, Arthur?</p>
